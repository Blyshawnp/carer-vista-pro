            <li><strong>Optional Break & Lunch Tracking:</strong> If break tracking is enabled by the organization, caregivers can clock in and out of lunches and rest breaks directly from active shifts. Shift durations, caregiver estimated pay, and client invoices are calculated after deducting unpaid break minutes automatically. Administrators can manually adjust break and lunch times with a mandatory note detailing the reason.</li>
            <li><strong>Holiday Pay & Client Surcharges:</strong> Organizations can configure active holidays with custom caregiver pay multipliers and flat bonuses, and client invoice surcharges (hourly multipliers, hourly surcharges, or flat surcharges). Shift details and invoice estimates compute these values automatically. Caregivers see their holiday rate and any flat bonuses in active shift previews.</li>
            <li><strong>Pay Deductions & Tax Estimates:</strong> Organizations can set optional caregiver pay deductions or tax estimates. <em>Important: This is not official payroll processing, is not enabled by default, and does not appear in the private app.</em> Before enabling, administrators must acknowledge that the app does not provide tax, payroll, legal, accounting, or employment classification advice.</li>

            <li><strong>Caregiver Appreciation Bonuses:</strong> Optional caregiver appreciation, holiday, performance, or manual adjustments can be funded by clients. In Agency/Company mode, bonuses submitted by clients must be approved by an administrator before they are visible to caregivers or added to the client invoice.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Financial Visibility:</strong> Caregivers see their own pay, bonuses, holiday multipliers, and total earned only. Clients and families see invoices, payments, and balances due (when allowed) but never see caregivers' pay rates or organization margins. Admins have full visibility of all charges, payouts, and margins.</li>
            <li><strong>Year-End Earning Reports:</strong> Optional and enabled/scheduled by organization administrators. Go to <strong>Me &rarr; Year-End Summaries</strong> to view them once released. Works on mobile, PWA, and desktop browsers.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Notice & No Advice:</strong> Employing organizations and clients are fully responsible for setting correct rates, invoices, taxes, payments, worker classification (W-2 vs. 1099), business records, tax prep (preparing and sending W-2, 1099, or other forms), and legal compliance under federal, state, and local wage/hour/payroll laws. The app does not provide payroll, tax, legal, accounting, or employment advice.</li>

            If you are not receiving native push notifications for messages, check-ins, or alerts, please check the following requirements:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm text-ink-750 space-y-1.5 list-disc pl-5">
            <li><strong>iPhone / iPad Users (iOS 16.4+):</strong> You must install the PWA to your Home Screen first! Standard browser tabs cannot receive background pushes. Tap Safari's <strong>Share</strong> button, select <strong>Add to Home Screen</strong>, launch the app from your home screen, navigate to <strong>Me → Notifications</strong>, and choose <strong>Enable on this device</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Android / Chrome Users:</strong> Launch the app, accept Chrome's system prompts, and enable notifications. Ensure Chrome is not restricted in your phone's general app notifications or battery optimization settings.</li>
            <li><strong>System Block Check:</strong> Verify that your device is not in Focus Mode, quiet mode, or Do Not Disturb. Ensure you have not explicitly blocked notification permissions for Carer Vista Pro in your browser or device operating system.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Dispatcher:</strong> Navigate to your notifications page and tap the <strong>Send test notification</strong> button. This immediately dispatches a secure system test push to verify your active VAPID credentials connection.</li>
